Welcome to R and RStudio
========================================================
author: Danny Kaplan, Nick Horton, and Randy Pruim
date: USCOTS 2013

This slide show introduces you to some basic commands in R, the `mosaic` package (which we'll be using in the USCOTS sessions), and RStudio.

* R is the language/environment for doing statistical and data-oriented computing.
* `mosaic` provides a few additional commands that we find helpful in smoothing the path for students.
* RStudio is an "integrated development environment" (IDE) that makes it easier for instructors to produce notes and for students to access the computational power of R without having to install or manage anything on their own computer.

Your RStudio Server account
===============

Each participant in the USCOTS workshop will be given an account on an RStudio web server.  You can also run R on your desktop, or even set up an RStudio web server of your own.  But for now, just use our server.

Log in to that server now.

* Once you are logged in, select FILE/OPEN FILE and ... how do we navigate to this `Welcome.Rpres` file?

Doing so will bring up these slides in the "Presentation" tab of your RStudio window.  Resize it as bests suits you.

Why Look at Slides in RStudio?
================

You can see these slides perfectly well in a web browser.  But still we want you to open them in RStudio.

* The slides, when open in RStudio, can interact with the R system itself.

This is a brand new feature of RStudio.  
 
* It allows us to demo certain features of R without your having to give commands that are (as yet) unfamiliar.
* We suspect that there will be pedagogical advantages to students in having materials presented in this format.  We are just starting to explore this possibility; this is our first attempt.

The Console and Basic Commands
=================
console: maximize, clear

The RStudio display is divided into several **panes**.  You can resize these at will.  

Panes contain **tabs** which give views into various aspects of R and RStudio.  

This slide show has just maximized the size of the pane containing the **Console**.

The console is where you enter commands interactively.  This is the most common way of using R, but there are others that you will see in these sessions.

You'll also be using the **Plots** tab.

Arithmetic
===============
console-input: 3+2
console-input: 3-2
console-input: 3*2
console-input: 3^2
console-input: 3/2

We've just put into the console commands illustrating basic arithmetic and exponentiation.
