What is Markdown?
========================================================

Like $\LaTeX$, a markup language for specifying structure in documents.

Works with both documents and slides.  Translation among a wide range of formats using `pandoc`.

Integrated with a variety of authoring systems, so you can ramp up to the level that's needed.
* Latex
* HTML (for just about anything)
* Tikz for graphics

Can access other systems through [knitr engines](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/), e.g. python


You can write and publish notes, articles, etc.  

Why Use Markdown?
========================================================

* Simple, but powerful enough
    * Fast and easy to edit
    * Many fewer compilation conundrums than Latex
* Integrated with R and publishing technologies such as HTML/JavaScript
* Easily published and updated
* Interactivity with R console (coming soon)

Who cares about HTML/JavaScript?
========================================================

You can use HTML/JavaScript to connect to other services.
* Google Forms
* Videos
* Demonstration Apps


A Shared Spreadsheet

An App
========================================================

In late October 2012, I assigned students to make a probability model of the electoral college outcome.  Then, right after the election, they calculated the likelihood of the observed outcome.  Putting it all on Nate Silver won!

How to Use Markdown?
========================================================

* Introduction via presentations
* Class notes
* Publishing (e.g. via RPubs)
* Notes for a whole course

Making a Class Presentation
========================================================

1. Open a new presentation and save the document under the name `2013-05-14-notes`.
2. Change the title of your first slide to say "Statistics 101 Notes"
3. Set the author and date
4. Add these bullet points to the first slide:
    * Including math notation in your notes
    * Including R in your notes
    * Including the `mosaic` package
    * The sampling distribution of the standard deviation.
