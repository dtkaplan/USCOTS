1. Including math notation in your notes
2. Including R in your notes
3. Including the `mosaic` package
4. The SE of the difference between two means

```{r include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
```

Including math notation via Latex markup
=========================================================
type: prompt

The next slides are about putting some math notation and R calculations in your slides, not about the best way to teach about the standard error of the mean.
    
Background
=========================================================

You're already familiar with the formula for the standard error of the mean.
* Calculation: $s/\sqrt{n}$ where $s$ is the sample standard deviation
* Uses: Construct a 95\% confidence interval.
    * The margin of error is $\pm 2 \times s/\sqrt{n}$
* Distribution: t distribution with $n-1$ df

Including R
==========================================================
Your R computations can be added to the presentation by including them in **fences**
```
    ` ``{r}
    3+2
    ```
```
This will appear in your finished document like this:
```{r}
3+2
```


Using `mosaic`
==========================================================
Each document must be **self-contained**.

This means that you should include the `mosaic` package (typically at the top of the document):

```{r}
require(mosaic)
```

Use the `include=FALSE` flag, e.g. `{r include=FALSE}` to supporess printing.

Small changes, then recompile
==========================================================
type: prompt

Make a small change, one or two chunks or lines, and recompile.



Calculation in R
==========================================================

The wage data: `CPS85`
```{r}
nrow(CPS85)
mean(wage, data=CPS85)
sd(wage, data=CPS85)
```

===============
title: false

The standard error of the mean is:
```{r}
sd(wage, data=CPS85)/sqrt(nrow(CPS85)-1)
```

SE of the Difference of Two Means
==========================================================

Starting data:
```{r}
mean(wage ~ sex, data=CPS85)
sd(wage ~ sex, data=CPS85)
tally(~sex, data=CPS85)
```

Now Write Your Notes!
==========================================================
You take it from here on.

Do the calculation.  Then compare it to the result you get in the t-test:

```{r eval=FALSE}
t.test(wage~sex, data=CPS85)
```
